    "Design a Python class ATM that simulates the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine. Your solution should meet the following requirements: \n",
    "➔ Card Activation: Prompt the user for their full name and a valid 10-digit mobile number to activate the ATM card. \n",
    "➔ PIN Creation: Ask the user to create a 4-digit PIN and re-enter it for verification. \n",
    "➔ Initial Deposit: Ensure a minimum deposit of ₹1000 during activation.\n",
    "➔ Main Menu: Provide options to: \n",
    " ◆ Change PIN \n",
    " ◆ Deposit Money \n",
    " ◆ Withdraw Money (with applicable transaction charges) \n",
    " ◆ Check Balance\n",
    " ◆ View Last 10 Transactions \n",
    " ◆ Exit the ATM \n",
    " ➔ Transaction Charges for withdrawals: \n",
    " ◆ ₹0 for <= ₹1000 \n",
    " ◆ ₹100 for <= ₹20000 \n",
    " ◆ ₹1000 for <= ₹100000 \n",
    " ◆ ₹2000 for > ₹1000000 \n",
    " ➔ Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs and ensure secure PIN-based access for every operation. \n",
    " ➔ Transaction History: Maintain a history of all deposits and withdrawals. Implement this functionality in a single Python class called ATM and demonstrate its usage. "
